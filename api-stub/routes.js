My lifesaver, “Mantecore”, who was the one responsible for pulling me to safety where the Paramedics could help me after my high blood pressure made me dizzy on stage. He is greatly missed, however, I have my memories and I know that now he is playing with his brother and sister.</p><p>I remember that when someone passed away my Mother always said, “They never really leave us they just go ahead”. For me, without “Mantecore” the Secret Garden feels empty; however, there are still 11 more White Tigers and 2 White Lions to remind us of our Ark of Noah – not to forget our 2 Black and 6 Spotted Leopards! Spring is in the air, so things could change as we have at least 2 females who are of age for breeding giving me hope for a New Generation.</p><p>I am sorry I had to deliver this sad news – now we need time to heal….I feel like a part of me is gone. As you all in reality know the story, “Mantecore” was one of a litter of three cubs born to a first time Mother. She was able to care for the first two babies, but by the time “Mantecore” arrived, she was so exhausted she wasn’t paying any attention to him. Without thinking twice I went into her space and got slowly closer; his umbilical cord was still attached, so I pinched it off with my fingernail and scooped him and placed him near her, and then she started to lick him. With a big sigh of relief I left the den, only to be called back later because he wasn’t looking so well. I went back to find him pretty lifeless, with a cold nose and blue lips. I gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and put him inside my shirt and held him tight. I told my staff to warm some towels in the microwave. With this little bundle of black and white stripes I made my way back to the Jungle Palace where we have a full nursery. My Mom took over his feeding every three hours and slowly but surely he recovered. My mouth-to-mouth resuscitation brought him back – I saved his life and then he saved mine, so we were even. His contribution to the avalanche of awareness of Conservation and Preservation as well as countless appearances in our Show, Television and Movies makes him unforgettable.</p><p>The flags at Little Bavaria are flying at half-mast – thank you everybody for listening – do not feel sad, I have wonderful memories.</p><p>Farewell my dear friend…..know that your image is forever burned into my heart.&quot;</p>"}],"summary":"Mantecore was 17 years old.","mediaList":null,"breaking_news":false,"show_on_cover":true,"ads_enabled":true,"comments_enabled":true,"search_enabled":true,"native_ad":false,"copyright":null,"cover_art":null,"tease_art":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/tiger-attacked-siegfried-roy-star-dies-n62171","short_url":"http://nbcnews.to/1fgQBcz","title_url_slug":"tiger-attacked-siegfried-roy-star-dies","original_canonical_url":"http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/tiger-who-attcked-siegfriend-roy-star-dies-n62171","type":"post","headline":"Tiger That Attacked 'Siegfried and Roy' Star Dies","headline_cover":"Tiger That Attacked 'Siegfried and Roy' Star Dies","headline_slug":"tiger-attacked-siegfried-roy-star-dies","bylines":null,"first_published_utc":"2014-03-26 00:42:18 Z","last_published_utc":"2014-03-26 02:21:21 Z","sections":[{"title":"Pop Culture","slug":"pop-culture"},{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"topics":[{"title":"Pop Culture News","slug":"pop-culture-news"},{"title":"U.S. news","slug":"us-news"}],"feature":[],"show":[],"storyline":[],"tags":[],"id":"NewsCms/Entry/62171","externalId":"62171","externalSource":"NewsCms","main_art":{"caption":"Siegfried and Roy pose with their white tiger, Mantecore.","url":"http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2014_13/279501/140325-mantecore-siegfried-roy-2027_6bdbee6defbf063bbd7fa818359b0f83.jpg","credit":null,"source":"Siegfried & Roy via Facebook","alt_text":"Image: Siegfried and Roy pose with their white tiger, Mantecore","width":2500,"height":2717,"title":"Image: Siegfried and Roy pose with their white tiger, Mantecore"}},{"body":[{"type":"url","html":"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-Jersey-Transit-Train-Delays-New-Brunswick-Trespassing-Police-252328571.html"},{"type":"source","html":"NBC New York"}],"summary":"A man was killed at the New Jersey Transit station in New Brunswick when he leaned into the path of an oncoming train Tuesday evening.","mediaList":null,"breaking_news":false,"show_on_cover":true,"ads_enabled":true,"comments_enabled":true,"search_enabled":true,"native_ad":false,"copyright":null,"cover_art":null,"tease_art":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-struck-killed-new-jersey-transit-train-officials-n62191","short_url":"http://nbcnews.to/1fh9jk4","title_url_slug":"man-struck-killed-new-jersey-transit-train-officials","original_canonical_url":"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-struck-killed-new-jersey-transit-train-officials-n62191","type":"externallink","headline":"Man Struck, Killed by New Jersey Transit Train: Officials","headline_cover":"Man Struck, Killed by New Jersey Transit Train: Officials","headline_slug":"man-struck-killed-new-jersey-transit-train-officials","bylines":null,"first_published_utc":"2014-03-26 02:12:18 Z","last_published_utc":"2014-03-26 02:12:18 Z","sections":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"topics":[{"title":"U.S. news","slug":"us-news"}],"feature":[],"show":[],"storyline":[],"tags":[],"id":"NewsCms/Entry/62191","externalId":"62191","externalSource":"NewsCms","main_art":null},{"body":[{"type":"p","html":"A county emergency chief insisted Tuesday that officials could not have anticipated the Washington mudslide that killed at least 16 people — and suggested it might have been triggered by a small earthquake almost two weeks earlier."},{"type":"p","html":"&quot;I want to know why this slide went, too,&quot;

(It also probably wants to avoid any horror stories of individuals who tried to sign up but couldn’t.) “We are experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment-either online or over the phone,&quot; an administration told NBC News. On the other hand, Republicans are arguing that this is yet another example of the administration making up the rules as they go along. “Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won’t work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats’ failed health-care law,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement."},{"type":"p","html":""},{"type":"widget","widget_type":"inline-video","mpxId":"207012931896","guid":"n_mj_toptalk1_140326","pubDate":"2014-03-26 11:16:00 Z","expirationDate":"9999-12-31 23:59:59 Z","playbackIsDisabled":false,"availabilityState":"available","title":"A new extension for Obamacare enrollment","description":"Top Talkers: The Obama administration is expected to announce a new change to Obamacare that would allow certain people more time to sign up for coverage.

Standing at the heart of Europe in Brussels, the center of the European project, he will be able to speak about the importance of European security, the importance of not just the danger to the people of Ukraine but the danger to the international system that Europe and the United States have invested so much in that is a consequence of Russia’s actions,” a senior administration told reporters yesterday. “But he’ll also be able to speak more broadly about why the alliance between the United States and Europe is so important to European security but also to the progress of democracy and the sustainment of international law around the world.” A few months ago, this speech was supposed to be heavy on trade and the economy as the president has been trying to negotiate a major regional trade deal between the U.S. and the EU; now it’s much heavier on security and Ukraine.

White House adviser Ben Rhodes also criticized Saudi Arabia: “We were very disappointed by the Saudi decision. We expressly reached out to the Saudi government through multiple channels when we became aware of this issue. We made it clear how important it was to us that this journalist, like any other journalist, have access to cover the president’s trip.” Bottom line: We know Saudi Arabia is frustrated that it doesn’t have a better relationship with President Obama. But that government’s actions -- including the lack of human rights there -- is only going to make it harder for future American presidents to have a close relationship with it, especially when the United States relies less and less on Middle East oil. For a country that used to be seen as being among the most political savvy about its Washington relationships, the country’s government has become remarkably tone deaf of late.

(It also probably wants to avoid any horror stories of individuals who tried to sign up but couldn’t.) “We are experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment-either online or over the phone,&quot; an administration told NBC News. On the other hand, Republicans are arguing that this is yet another example of the administration making up the rules as they go along. “Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won’t work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats’ failed health-care law,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement."},{"type":"p","html":""},{"type":"widget","widget_type":"inline-video","mpxId":"207012931896","guid":"n_mj_toptalk1_140326","pubDate":"2014-03-26 11:16:00 Z","expirationDate":"9999-12-31 23:59:59 Z","playbackIsDisabled":false,"availabilityState":"available","title":"A new extension for Obamacare enrollment","description":"Top Talkers: The Obama administration is expected to announce a new change to Obamacare that would allow certain people more time to sign up for coverage.

Standing at the heart of Europe in Brussels, the center of the European project, he will be able to speak about the importance of European security, the importance of not just the danger to the people of Ukraine but the danger to the international system that Europe and the United States have invested so much in that is a consequence of Russia’s actions,” a senior administration told reporters yesterday. “But he’ll also be able to speak more broadly about why the alliance between the United States and Europe is so important to European security but also to the progress of democracy and the sustainment of international law around the world.” A few months ago, this speech was supposed to be heavy on trade and the economy as the president has been trying to negotiate a major regional trade deal between the U.S. and the EU; now it’s much heavier on security and Ukraine.

White House adviser Ben Rhodes also criticized Saudi Arabia: “We were very disappointed by the Saudi decision. We expressly reached out to the Saudi government through multiple channels when we became aware of this issue. We made it clear how important it was to us that this journalist, like any other journalist, have access to cover the president’s trip.” Bottom line: We know Saudi Arabia is frustrated that it doesn’t have a better relationship with President Obama. But that government’s actions -- including the lack of human rights there -- is only going to make it harder for future American presidents to have a close relationship with it, especially when the United States relies less and less on Middle East oil. For a country that used to be seen as being among the most political savvy about its Washington relationships, the country’s government has become remarkably tone deaf of late.
